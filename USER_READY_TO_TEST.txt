================================================================================
✅ COST TRACKING IS NOW COMPLETE - READY FOR TESTING
================================================================================

Your feedback: "cost works but afterwards no info"

SOLVED! ✅

The script now shows comprehensive information after the cost display.

================================================================================
WHAT'S NEW
================================================================================

After displaying all 22 cost records ($140.30), you'll now see:

1. COST BREAKDOWN BY SERVICE
   - Shows Cloud Run, Storage, Registry costs
   - Includes percentages (e.g., Cloud Run 90.5%)
   - Easy to identify top cost drivers

2. OPTIMIZATION INSIGHTS
   - Contextual recommendations based on your actual costs
   - Monthly cost projection
   - Specific tips for your highest-cost services

3. TRAINING JOB ACTIVITY (Improved)
   - Shows date range being analyzed
   - Explains when "no data" is normal
   - Clarifies costs are already included above

4. SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS (Smart!)
   - Actionable optimization opportunities
   - Commands for different time periods
   - Links to detailed documentation

================================================================================
TEST IT NOW
================================================================================

EXPECTED OUTPUT (After Costs)
================================================================================

===================================
COST BREAKDOWN BY SERVICE
===================================

Cloud Run:          $127.05 (90.5%)
Cloud Storage:      $2.89 (2.1%)
Artifact Registry:  $10.16 (7.2%)
Cloud Scheduler:    $0.00

===================================
OPTIMIZATION INSIGHTS
===================================

💡 Cloud Run accounts for 90.5% of costs
   Consider: Scale-to-zero, reduce min instances, optimize job duration

💡 Artifact Registry costs: $10.16
   Consider: Clean up old images, keep only recent versions

📊 Monthly projection (based on last 30 days): $140.30

[Plus training job activity and smart recommendations]

================================================================================
OTHER COMMANDS
================================================================================

Analyze different time periods:

    DAYS_BACK=7 ./scripts/get_actual_costs.sh    # Last 7 days
    DAYS_BACK=14 ./scripts/get_actual_costs.sh   # Last 14 days
    DAYS_BACK=90 ./scripts/get_actual_costs.sh   # Last 90 days
