## Notes

- Use the appropriate comment syntax for each file type
- Update the copyright year as needed
- Include the header at the very top of the file (after shebang for scripts)
- For existing files, you may choose to add headers gradually or all at once
- The header should be concise but clearly indicate proprietary nature
