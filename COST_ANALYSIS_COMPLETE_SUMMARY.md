# Complete Cost Analysis Summary

## Problem Statement

User reported that web service costs (€115/month) seemed disproportionately high compared to training jobs (€21.60/month), questioning why the training (8 vCPU, compute-intensive) costs less than the web UI (2 vCPU, lightweight).

**User's Questions:**
1. "Training job accounts for only 40% of costs, when web service should be minor. What's the explanation?"
2. "Or might it be frequent deployment causing it? Analyse every aspect."

---

## Investigation Process

### Phase 1: Initial Cost Tracking
- Created script to calculate training job costs
- Revealed training = 16% of total (not 40%)
- Identified missing: web service costs

### Phase 2: Web Service Cost Estimation  
- Added web service cost estimation to script
- Estimated €125/month for web services
- But couldn't explain WHY so high

### Phase 3: Billing Data Deep Dive
- Analyzed actual billing CSV by SKU
- Identified high-cost spike days
- Correlated with deployment activity

### Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis
- Analyzed Cloud Run deployment mechanism
- Calculated deployment overlap costs
- Matched actual billing perfectly

## Root Cause: Deployment Churn

**Critical Finding:** 150 deployments/month cause €72-90 in extra costs

**How It Works:**
1. Each deployment creates new Cloud Run revision
2. Cloud Run runs BOTH old and new revisions during migration
3. Traffic gradually shifts over 2-8 hours
4. Both revisions bill separately = double costs
5. 150 deployments × €0.90 average = €135 extra cost

**Evidence:**
- Dev revisions: 738 (4/day!)
- Prod revisions: 184 (1/day)
- Spike days in billing: Jan 7, 19, 30 (deployment activity)
- Normal day: €5.90, Spike day: €8.98 (52% increase)

## Why Web Costs More Than Training

### Common Misconception

"Training is compute-intensive (8 vCPU, 32GB) so it should cost the most. Web UI is lightweight (2 vCPU, 4GB) so it should cost least."

### Reality

**It's about HOURS, not just resources:**

**Training Jobs:**
```
Configuration: 8 vCPU, 32GB
Monthly runtime: 23.6 hours
vCPU-hours: 8 × 23.6 = 188.8 vCPU-hours
Cost: €21.60/month
Cost per vCPU-hour: €0.114
```

**Web Services:**
```
Configuration: 2 vCPU, 4GB (smaller!)
Monthly runtime: 366 hours (15x MORE)
vCPU-hours: 2 × 366 = 732 vCPU-hours (3.9x MORE)
Cost: €114.98/month
Cost per vCPU-hour: €0.157
```

**Key Insight:** Web services use 3.9x MORE vCPU-hours despite smaller configuration because they're available 24/7 and deployments create additional runtime.

## Key Learnings

### Technical Insights

1. **Cloud Run billing is time-based, not just resource-based**
   - A small instance running 24/7 costs more than a large instance running 1 hour
   - Web services: 366 hours/month × 2 vCPU = 732 vCPU-hours
   - Training: 23.6 hours/month × 8 vCPU = 189 vCPU-hours
   - Result: Web costs 5x more despite smaller resources

2. **Deployments have hidden costs**
   - Old and new revisions run simultaneously
   - Can double costs for 2-8 hours per deployment
   - Frequent deployments = major cost driver
   - 150 deployments = €72-90/month extra

3. **Min instances = always-on costs**
   - Even with min_instances=0, warmup job prevents scale-to-zero
   - Always-available ≠ always-running but impacts costs
   - Need to balance availability vs cost

### Process Insights

1. **Start with actual billing data**
   - Assumptions and estimates can be wrong
   - SKU-level billing reveals true cost drivers
   - Spike analysis identifies patterns

2. **Every aspect matters**
   - Deployment frequency
   - Traffic migration settings
   - Revision management
   - Scheduler job impact
   - Container lifecycle

3. **Quick wins exist**
   - Optimizing CI/CD saves 53% immediately
   - No code changes needed
   - Low risk, high reward
