OPTIMIZATION NOTES,,,,,,,
,"1. Reduce min_instances from 2 to 0 to eliminate $42.34/month idle cost (trade-off: cold starts)",,,,,,
,"2. Use Cloud Storage lifecycle policies to archive old results to Nearline ($0.010/GB) or Coldline ($0.004/GB)",,,,,,
,"3. Configure log retention policies to reduce log storage costs",,,,,,
,"4. Implement request caching to reduce Snowflake query costs",,,,,,
,"5. Compress training results before uploading to GCS to reduce storage and egress costs",,,,,,
,"6. Use Cloud Run jobs with spot/preemptible instances when available (up to 50% savings)",,,,,,
,"7. Consider regional vs. multi-regional GCS for cost vs. availability trade-off",,,,,,
,"8. Optimize Docker images to reduce Artifact Registry storage",,,,,,
